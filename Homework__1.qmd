# Introduction

The palmerpenguins dataset is a widely used dataset for teaching data visualization in R. It contains observations of penguins from three species—*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, and *Gentoo*—collected in Antarctica.

This dataset is useful for understanding how physical characteristics such as **body mass**, **flipper length**, and **bill size** vary across species.


#Note: This dataset focuses on Palmer penguins species and measurements.

# Dataset Description

The key variables we’ll focus on are:

- **species**: Penguin species (*Adelie*, *Chinstrap*, *Gentoo*)
- **body_mass_g**: Body mass in grams
- **sex**: Penguin sex (*male* or *female*)

# Summary Statistics

Let’s briefly examine the distribution of body mass across species and sexes:

- Average body mass (g):  
  - *Adelie*: ~3700 g  
  - *Chinstrap*: ~3730 g  
  - *Gentoo*: ~5075 g

These numbers suggest that **Gentoo penguins are generally larger** than the other two species.

# Body Mass by Species and Sex

The bar plot below shows the **average body mass** of male and female penguins across different species.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)

ggplot(na.omit(penguins), aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean", position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(
    title = "Average Penguin Body Mass by Species and Sex",
    x = "Penguin Species",
    y = "Body Mass (grams)",
    fill = "Sex"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("female" = "#FF9999", "male" = "#6699CC")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Explanation

This plot illustrates differences in body mass across penguin species, split by sex:

- **Male penguins** consistently weigh more than females.
- **Gentoo penguins** are the heaviest, regardless of sex.
- **Adelie** and **Chinstrap** penguins are smaller in comparison.

# Interpretation

The visualized data clearly shows that **species** and **sex** are significant factors influencing penguin body mass. These patterns might relate to habitat, diet, or evolutionary traits specific to each species.
